Introduction
------------
VOMBAT is a plugin for [CloudCompare](https://github.com/cloudcompare/trunk, "cloudcompare link on github") which is developed as frontend for the [SPC] (https://github.com/luca-penasa/spc) library. 

Altough at the moment is far away from being considered in a release state, it allows to perform various stratigraphic-related operations on point clouds within the confortable environment provided by CloudCompare, e.g. reconstructing stratigraphic logs derived from the scalar fields associated with the clouds.
